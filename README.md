# WebDev Odyssey 🌐✨
Welcome to **WebDev Odyssey** — my personal journey into web development. 
This repository will serve as a living journal where I document exercises, projects, and experiments as I grow from the basics to advanced concepts.

---

## 🚀 Goals 
- Practice daily/weekly exercises to strengthen fundamentals.
- Build small projects to apply new skills.
- Explore modern frameworks, tools, and best practices.
- Track progress and reflect on lessons learned.
